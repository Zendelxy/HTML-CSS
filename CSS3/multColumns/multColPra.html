        A newspaper is a periodical publication containing written information
        about current events and is often typed in black ink with a white or
        gray background. Newspapers can cover a wide variety of fields such as
        politics, business, sports, art, and science. They often include
        materials such as opinion columns, weather forecasts, reviews of local
        services, obituaries, birth notices, crosswords, sudoku puzzles,
        editorial cartoons, comic strips, and advice columns.

        Most newspapers are businesses, and they pay their expenses with a
        mixture of subscription revenue, newsstand sales, and advertising
        revenue. The journalism organizations that publish newspapers are
        themselves often metonymically called newspapers. Newspapers have
        traditionally been published in print (usually on cheap, low-grade paper
        called newsprint). However, today most newspapers are also published on
        websites as online newspapers, and some have even abandoned their print
        versions entirely.

        Newspapers developed in the 17th century as information sheets for
        merchants. By the early 19th century, many cities in Europe, as well as
        North and South America, published newspapers. Some newspapers with high
        editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation
        are viewed as newspapers of record. With the popularity of the Internet,
        many newspapers are now digital, with their news presented online as the
        main medium that most of the readers use, with the print edition being
        secondary (for the minority of customers that choose to pay for it) or,
        in some cases, retired. The decline of newspapers in the early 21st
        century was at first largely interpreted as a mere print-versus-digital
        contest in which digital beats print. The reality is different and
        multivariate, as newspapers now routinely have online presence; anyone
        willing to subscribe can read them digitally online. Factors such as
        classified ads no longer being a large revenue center (because of other
        ways to buy and sell online) and ad impressions now being dispersed
        across many media are inputs.
